# Testing some SDL and Scene switching
I did some Scene switching in my Raylib + Zig adventure and the Scene system there with tagget unions and switch cases ended up being overly complicated I think

Inspired by the standard library of Zig, I made a Vtable version instead with a interface, already liking it a lot more.
Next: Scene switching!
